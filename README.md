# bintag

```js
var bintag = require('bintag');
```

A Node.js module for creating buffers using tagged template strings.

## Introduction

This module uses the [tagged template
string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/template_strings#Tagged_template_strings)
syntax to fill buffers with structured binary data.

The simplest example:

```js
bintag`i4: 1 2 -10 0xaabbccdd`
// = <Buffer 01 00 00 00 02 00 00 00 f6 ff ff ff dd cc bb aa>
```

The expression evaluates to a new `Buffer` instance.

The `i4:` is a _format specifier_ which means that the numbers following it
should be formatted as 4-byte integers.

Note that template strings can be multi-line:

```js
bintag`i1:
    0x12 0x34
    0x56 0x78`
// = <Buffer 12 34 56 78>
```

## Substitutions

The template string syntax allows substitutions: `${`_expression_`}`. With
`bintag`, you can use substitutions as values to be formatted as well as in
other syntactic constructs.

### Substitutions as values

A substitution expression can evaluate to a single value:

```js
let n = 10;
bintag`i4: ${n}`
// = <Buffer 0a 00 00 00>
```

It can evaluate to an array of values:

```js
let array = [1, 2, 3];
bintag`i1: ${array}`
// = <Buffer 01 02 03>
```

Nested arrays will be flattened:

```js
let array = [1, [2], 3, [[4]], [5, 6], 7];
bintag`i1: ${array}`
// = <Buffer 01 02 03 04 05 06 07>
```

Anything
[iterable](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#iterable),
such as a `Set` or a generator, will be treated the same way as an array:

```js
function* gen(){
    yield 1;
    yield 2;
    yield [3, 4];
}
bintag`i1: ${gen()}`
// = <Buffer 01 02 03 04>
```

Unless the iterable is a generator, it must produce stable results on two
subsequent traversals, or the result will be undefined.

A substitution expression can also evaluate to a `Buffer`:

```js
let buf = bintag`i1: 0xaa 0xbb`;
bintag`${buf} i2: 2 ${buf}`
// = <Buffer aa bb 02 00 aa bb>
```

Arrays and nested arrays of buffers are also supported. You can even mix
buffers with immediate values in the same array. An empty array produces no
buffer content.


â€¦and even as parts of format specifiers:

```js
let n=2;
bintag`i${n}: 

## Format specifiers

A format specifier itself does not produce any buffer content, but it specifies
the format in which the values following it are to be formatted. The format
remains active until another format specifier is encountered:

```js
bintag`i1: 1 2 i4: 7 i1: 8`
// = <Buffer 01 02 07 00 00 00 08>
```
